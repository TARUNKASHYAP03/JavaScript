        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programming languages to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages.</p>
        <p>The DOM provides a way to access and modify the content and structure of HTML and XML documents. It allows developers to create dynamic web pages by adding, removing, or changing elements in the document.</p>
        <p>In the DOM, each element in a document is represented as an object. These objects can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript or other programming languages that support the DOM API.</p>
